# Module-specific.

# PREPARATION
# Create some data set.
# Assign field stars based on rules.
# Assign cluster candidates based on rules.
# Assign cluster members based on rules.
# Write the data to disk.

# ASSIGNING REALISATIONS
# Create realisations using the data table.
# Save the information about the realisations to disk.

# DATA ANALYSIS
# For each realisation, we need to use particular amounts of data and try and
# work out the number of clusters present.

# Scripts for running on each realisation. Each script might be using a
# different amount of data (e.g., metallicities only?)
